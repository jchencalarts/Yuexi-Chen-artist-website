                My name is (Jessica)Yuexi Chen, I am currently a BFA 2 in the Fine Arts Program at California Institute of the Arts. I was born in Chengdu, China and lived there for eleven years. I moved to New York in 2015, where I stayed until moving to California in 2022 for my BFA Education at Calarts.
                My Metier at Calarts is Fine Arts; my main practice includes multimedia art as well as traditional art. I create abstract pieces that are focused on fluidity and form.

            <div class="item item-2"> <p>My past works utilized more traditional mediums such as oil paint, acrylic paint, ink and watercolor. My more recent works have been multimedia. For example, some pieces are time-based, structure oriented and installations. </p></div>
